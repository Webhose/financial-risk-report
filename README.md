# financial-risk-report
This Python script automates the process of generating weekly financial risk reports. It fetches negative sentiment news articles from Webz.io, analyzes them using ChatGPT for financial risks, and compiles a structured financial risk report in a Word document. The script also generates a featured image for each report using OpenAI's DALL-E model.
